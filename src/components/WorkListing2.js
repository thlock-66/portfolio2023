                        As part of NCS Product and Platforms, I worked as a UX Designer to design robotic screens for a robotic nurse assistant that is deployed in hospitals to aid patients.

                        <br></br>
                        Some flows I designed for were taking a patientâ€™s blood pressure, as well as measuring their respiratory rate. Due to the small robotic screen, I kept the design as simple as possible, creating gifs in AfterEffects to teach patients how to interact with the specialized equipment installed in the robot.

                </div>
            </div>
            <div className="content-row">
                <div className="col-5">

                        One challenge was that the time taken to measure respiratory rate takes a long time, patients cannot move while this happens, yet informing patients that respiratory measurements are taken will affect their breathing as they become conscious of it. To solve this, I combined the flows of measuring BP and RR, and came up with various ways to distract patients.                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Through some basic user testing, though the time taken remained constant, we managed to decrease the perceived time taken for measurements through UX changes.
